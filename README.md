# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models to classify wine quality.
Wine Quality is a subjective characteristic influenced by several chemical attributes such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels. Using a machine learning model, this project predicts wine quality ratings based on a dataset of physicochemical tests and expert evaluations.
The dataset used in this project is publicly available.
The project explores: Data preproceesing and visualisation, Model selection and hyperparameter tuning and Model evaluation using metrices such as accuracy and F1-score.
